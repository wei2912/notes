\title{Chapter 8: Least Upper Bounds}
\maketitle

\begin{definition}
  A set $A$ of real numbers is \emph{bounded above} if there is a number $x$
  such that \[
    x \geq a \text{ for every } a \text{ in } A.
  \] Such a number $x$ is called an \emph{upper bound} for $A$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  A number $x$ is the \emph{least upper bound} of $A$ if
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $x$ is an upper bound of $A$, and
    \item if $y$ is an upper bound of $A$, then $x \leq y$.
  \end{itemize}

  The term \emph{supremum} of $A$ is synonymous with "least upper bound" and
  abbreviates to $\sup A$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  A set $A$ of real number is \emph{bounded below} if there is a number $x$
  such that
  \[
    x \leq a \text{ for every } a \text{ in } A.
  \]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  A number $x$ is the \emph{greatest lower bound} of $A$ if
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $x$ is an upper bound of $A$, and
    \item if $y$ is an upper bound of $A$, then $x \geq y$.
  \end{itemize}

  The term \emph{infimum} of $A$ is synonymous with "least upper bound" and
  abbreviates to $\inf A$.
\end{definition}

The last property of the real numbers can be stated:

\begin{tabular}{l p{1.8in}}
  (P13: The least upper bound property) & If $A$ is a set of real numbers, $A
  \neq \varnothing$, and $A$ is bounded above, then $A$ has a least upper
  bound.
\end{tabular}

We shall apply P13 to the proofs that were omitted in Chapter 7.

\begin{theorem*}[Theorem 7-1]
  If $f$ is continuous on $[a, b]$ and $f(a) < 0 < f(b)$, then there is some
  number $x$ in $[a, b]$ such that $f(x) = 0$.
\end{theorem*}
\begin{proof}
  Define the set $A$ as follows: \[
    A = \{x : a \leq x \leq b, \text{ and } f \text{ is negative on the interval
      } [a, x]\}.
  \] Clearly $A \neq \varnothing$, since $a$ is in $A$; in fact, there is some
  $\delta > 0$ such that $A$ contains all points $x$ satisfying $a \leq x < a +
  \delta$; this follows from Problem 6-15, since $f$ is continuous on $[a, b]$
  and $f(a) < 0$. Similarly, $b$ is an upper bound for $A$ and, in fact, there
  is a $\delta > 0$ such that all points $x$ satisfying $b - \delta < x \leq b$
  are upper bounds for $A$; this also follows from Problem 6-15, since $f(b) >
  0$.

  From these remarks it follows that $A$ has a least upper bound $\alpha$ and
  that $a < \alpha < b$. We now wish to show that $f(\alpha) = 0$, by
  eliminating the possibilities $f(\alpha) < 0$ and $f(\alpha) > 0$.

  Suppose first that $f(\alpha) < 0$. By Theorem 6-3, there is a $\delta > 0$
  such that $f(x) < 0$ for $\alpha - \delta < x < \alpha + \delta$. Now there is
  some number $x_0$ in $A$ which satisfies $\alpha - \delta < x_0 < \alpha$
  (because otherwise $\alpha$ would not be the \emph{least} upper bound of $A$).
  This means that $f$ is negative on the whole interval $[a, x_0]$. But if $x_1$
  is a number between $\alpha$ and $\alpha + \delta$, then $f$ is also negative
  on the whole interval $[x_0, x_1]$. Therefore $f$ is negative on the interval
  $[a, x_1]$, so $x_1$ is in $A$. But this contradicts the fact that $\alpha$ is
  an upper bound for $A$; our original assumption that $f(\alpha) < 0$ must be
  false.

  Suppose, on the other hand, that $f(\alpha) > 0$. Then there is a number
  $\delta > 0$ such that $f(x) > 0$ for $\alpha - \delta < x < \alpha + \delta$.
  Once again we know that there is an $x_0$ in $A$ satisfying $\alpha - \delta <
  x_0 < \alpha$; but this means that $f$ is negative on $[a, x_0]$, which is
  impossible, since $f(x_0) > 0$. Thus the assumption $f(\alpha) > 0$ also leads
  to a contradiction, leaving $f(\alpha) = 0$ as the only possible alternative.
\end{proof}

The proofs of Theorems 2 and 3 of Chapter 7 require a simple preliminary
result, which will play much the same role as Theorem 6-3 played in the
previous proof.

\begin{theorem}
  If $f$ is continuous at $a$, then there is a number $\delta > 0$ such that
  $f$ is bounded above on the interval $(a - \delta, a + \delta)$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Since $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)$, there is, for every $\epsilon > 0$, a
  $\delta > 0$ such that, for all $x$, \[
    \text{if } |x - a| < \delta, \text{ then } |f(x) - f(a)| < \epsilon.
  \] It follows that if $|x - a| < \delta$, then $f(x) - f(a) < \epsilon$. This
  completes the proof: on the interval $(a - \delta, a + \delta)$ the function
  $f$ is bounded above by $f(a) + \epsilon$.
\end{proof}

Observe that if $\lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = f(a)$, then there is a $\delta > 0$
such that $f$ is bounded on the set $\{x: a \leq x < a + \delta\}$, and a
similar observation holds if $\lim_{x \to b^-} f(x) = f(b)$. Having made these
observations, we tackle our second major theorem.

\begin{theorem*}[Theorem 7-2]
  If $f$ is continuous on $[a, b]$, then $f$ is bounded above on $[a, b]$.
\end{theorem*}
\begin{proof}
  Let \[
    A = \{x: a \leq x \leq b \text{ and } f \text{ is bounded above on } [a,
      x]\}.
  \] Clearly $A \neq \varnothing$ (since $a$ is in $A$), and $A$ is bounded
  above (by $b$), so $A$ has a least upper bound $\alpha$. Notice that we are
  here applying the term "bounded above" both to the set $A$, which can be
  visualized as lying on the horizontal axis, and to $f$, i.e., to the sets
  $\{f(y): a \leq y \leq x\}$, which can be visualized as lying on the vertical
  axis.

  Our first step is to prove that we actually have $\alpha = b$. Suppose,
  instead, that $\alpha < b$. By Theorem 1 there is $\delta > 0$ such that $f$
  is bounded on $(\alpha - \delta, \alpha + \delta)$. Since $\alpha$ is the
  least upper bound of $A$ there is some $x_0$ in $A$ satisfying $\alpha -
  \delta < x_0 < \alpha$. This means that $f$ is bounded on $[a, x_0]$. But if
  $x_1$ is any number with $\alpha < x_1 < \alpha + \delta$, then $f$ is also
  bounded on $[x_0, x_1]$. Therefore $f$ is bounded on $[a, x_1]$, so $x_1$ is
  in $A$, contradicting the fact that $\alpha$ is an upper bound for $A$. This
  contradiction shows that $\alpha = b$. One detail should be mentioned: this
  demonstration implicitly assumed that $a < \alpha$ [so that $f$ would be
  defined on some interval $(\alpha - \delta, \alpha + \delta)$]; the
  possibility $a = \alpha$ can be ruled out similarly, using the existence of a
  $\delta > 0$ such that $f$ is bounded on $\{x: a \leq x < a + \delta\}$.

  The proof is not quite complete - we only know that $f$ is bounded on $[a,
  x]$ for every $x < b$, not necessarily that $f$ is bounded on $[a, b]$.
  However, only one small argument needs to be added.

  There is a $\delta > 0$ such that $f$ is bounded on $\{x: b - \delta < x \leq
  b\}$. There is $x_0$ in $A$ such that $b - \delta < x_0 < b$. Thus $f$ is
  bounded on $[a, x_0]$ and also $[x_0, b]$, so $f$ is bounded on $[a, b]$.
\end{proof}

To prove the third important theorem we resort to a trick.

\begin{theorem*}[Theorem 7-3]
  If $f$ is continuous on $[a, b]$, then there is a number $y$ in $[a, b]$ such
  that $f(y) \geq f(x)$ for all $x$ in $[a, b]$.
\end{theorem*}
\begin{proof}
  We already know that $f$ is bounded on $[a, b]$, which means that the set \[
    \{f(x): x \in [a, b]\}
  \] is bounded. This set is obviously not $\varnothing$, so it has a least
  upper bound $\alpha$. Since $\alpha \geq f(x)$ for $x$ in $[a, b]$ it
  suffices to show that $\alpha = f(y)$ for some $y$ in $[a, b]$.

  Suppose instead that $\alpha \neq f(y)$ for all $y$ in $[a, b]$. Then the
  function $g$ defined by \[
    g(x) = \frac{1}{\alpha - f(x)}, x \in [a, b]
  \] is continuous on $[a, b]$, since the denominator of the right side is
  never 0. On the other hand, $\alpha$ is the least upper bound of $\{f(x): x
  \in [a, b]\}$; this means that \[
    \text{for every } \epsilon > 0 \text{ there is } x \in [a, b] \text{ with }
    \alpha - f(x) < \epsilon.
  \] This, in turn, means that \[
    \text{for every } \epsilon > 0 \text{ there is } x \in [a, b] \text{ with }
    g(x) > \frac{1}{\epsilon}.
  \] But \emph{this} means that $g$ is not bounded on $[a, b]$, contradicting
  the previous theorem.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
  $\mathbb{N}$ is not bounded above.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Suppose $\mathbb{N}$ were bounded above. Since $\mathbb{N} \neq \varnothing$,
  there would be a least upper bound $\alpha$ for $\mathbb{N}$. Then \[
    \alpha \geq n \text{ for all } n \in \mathbb{N}.
  \] Consequently, \[
    \alpha \geq n + 1 \text{ for all } n \in \mathbb{N},
  \] since $n + 1$ is in $\mathbb{N}$ if $n$ is in $\mathbb{N}$. But this means
  that \[
    \alpha - 1 \geq n \text{ for all } n \in \mathbb{N},
  \] and \emph{this} means that $\alpha - 1$ is also an upper bound for
  $\mathbb{N}$, contradicting the fact that $\alpha$ is the least upper bound.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
  For any $\epsilon > 0$ there is a natural number $n$ with $1/n < \epsilon$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Suppose not; then $1/n \geq \epsilon$ for all $n$ in $\mathbb{N}$. Thus $n
  \leq 1/\epsilon$ for all $n$ in $\mathbb{N}$. But this means that
  $1/\epsilon$ is an upper bound for $\mathbb{N}$, contradicting Theorem 2.
\end{proof}

\section*{Exercises}

\paragraph{Problem 6}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item By definition of continuity, we have $f(a) = \lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ for
    all $a$, so it suffices to prove that $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = 0$ (knowing
    that the limit $l$ exists).

    Given $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that $|f(x) - l| <
    \epsilon$ for all $x$ satisfying $0 < |x - a| < \delta$. Since $A$ is
    dense, there is a number $x$ in $A$ satisfying $0 < |x - a| < \delta$; so
    $|0 - l| < \epsilon$. Since this is true for all $\epsilon > 0$, it follows
    that $l = 0$.
  \item Consider $h = f - g$, which is continuous, and apply the part (a).
  \item As in part (a) and (b), it suffices to prove that if $f$ is continuous
    and $f(x) \geq 0$ for all numbers $x$ in $A$, then $l = \lim_{x \to a} f(a)
    \geq 0$ for all $a$. Pick $\epsilon = |l|/2$; now, there is a $\delta > 0$
    such that, for all $x$, if $0 < |x - a| < \delta$, then $|f(x) - l| <
    |l|/2$. This implies that $f(x) < l + |l|/2$; if $l < 0$, it would follow
    that $f(x) < l/2 < 0$, which would be false for those $x$ in $A$ which
    satisfy $0 < |x - a| < \delta$.

    It is not possible to replace $\geq$ by $>$; consider the case of $f(x) =
    |x|$ for the dense set $A = \{x : x \in \mathbb{R}, x \neq 0\}$, where
    $f(x) > 0$ for all $x \in A$, but $f(0) \ngtr 0$.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Problem 8}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item The set $\{f(x): x < a\}$ is bounded above (by $f(a)$); let $\alpha =
    \sup\{f(x): x < a\}$. Then it suffices to prove $\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) =
    \alpha$.

    Given any $\epsilon > 0$, there is some $f(x)$ for $x < a$ with $f(x) >
    \alpha - \epsilon$, since $\alpha$ is the least upper bound of $\{f(x): x <
    a\}$. Let $\delta = a - x$. If $a - \delta < y < a$, then $x < y < a$, so
    $f(x) \leq f(y)$. This means that $\alpha \geq f(y) > \alpha - \epsilon$,
    so surely $|f(y) - \alpha| < \epsilon$.

    The proof that $\lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = \inf\{f(x): x > a\}$ is similar.
  \item It is clear from (a) that \[
      \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) \leq f(a) \leq \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x).
    \] If $\lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ exists, it follows that \[
      \lim_{x \to a} f(x)
      = \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x)
      \leq f(a)
      \leq \lim_{x \to a^+}f(x)
      = \lim_{x \to a}f(x),
    \] so $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)$. This means that $f$ is continuous at
    $a$, so $f$ cannot have a removable discontinuity.
  \item Suppose that $f$ is not continuous at some point $a$. It follows from
    (b) that \[
      \sup\{f(x): x < a\}
      = \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x)
      < \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x)
      = \inf\{f(x): x > a\},
    \] and so $f(x)$ cannot have any value between $\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x)$ and
    $\lim_{x \to a^+} f(x)$, except $f(a)$, so $f$ cannot satisfy the
    Intermediate Value Theorem.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Problem 14}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item For every $m$ and $n$ we have $a_m \leq b_n$, because $a_m \leq a_{m+n}
    \leq b_{m+n} \leq b_n$. It follows that $\sup\{a_n: n \in \mathbb{N}\} \leq
    \inf\{b_n: n \in \mathbb{N}\}$. Let $x$ be any number between these two
    numbers. Then $a_n \leq x \leq b_n$ for all $n$, so $x$ is in every $I_n$.
  \item Consider $I_n = (0, 1/n)$.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Problem 15} Let $c$ be in each $I_n$. If $f(c) < 0$, then there is
some $\delta > 0$ such that $f(x) < 0$ for all $x$ in $[a, b]$ with $|x - c| <
\delta$. Choose $n$ with $1/2^n < \delta$. Since $c$ is in $I_n$, which has
total length $1/2^n$, it follows that all points of $I_n$ satisfy $|x - c| <
\delta$. This contradicts the fact that $f$ changes sign on $I_n$. Similarly,
we cannot have $f(c) > 0$. So $f(c) = 0$.

\paragraph{Problem 16} Let $c$ be in each $I_n$. Since $f$ is continuous at $c$,
there is a $\delta > 0$ such that $f$ is bounded on the set of all points $x$
satisfying $|x - c| < \delta$. Choose $n$ with $1/2^n < \delta$. Since $c$ is
in $I_n$, all points $x$ of $I_n$ satisfy $|x - c| < \delta$. This contradicts
the fact that $f$ is not bounded on $I_n$.

\paragraph{Problem 18}
\begin{enumerate}[(b)]
  \item Any upper bound of $A$ is certainly an almost upper bound, so $B \neq
    \varnothing$. However, no lower bound of $A$ can possibly be an almost
    lower bound (as $A$ is infinite), so $B$ is bounded below by any lower
    bound for $A$.
\end{enumerate}

It follows from Problem 18(b) that $\inf B$ exists; this number is called the
\emph{limit superior} of $A$, and denoted by $\olim A$ or $\limsup A$.
$\ulim A$ is defined similarly.

\paragraph{Problem 19}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item If $x$ is an almost lower bound of $A$ and $y$ is an almost upper bound
    of $A$, then there are only finitely many numbers in $A$ which are $< x$ or
    $> y$. Since $A$ is infinite, it follows that we must have $x \leq y$. Thus
    $\ulim A \leq \olim A$.
  \item This is clear, since $\olim A \leq \alpha$ for any almost upper bound
    $\alpha$, and $\alpha = \sup A$ is an almost upper bound.
  \item If $\olim A < \sup A$ then there is some almost upper bound $x$ of $A$
    with $x < \sup A$. So, there are only finitely many numbers which are
    greater than $x$ (and there is at least one, since $x < \sup A$). The
    largest of these finitely many numbers greater than $x$ is the largest
    element of $A$.
\end{enumerate}
