\begin{definition}
  The function $f$ is \emph{continuous at $a$} if $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)$.

  If $f$ is continuous at $x$ for all $x$ in $(a, b)$, then $f$ is called
  \emph{continuous on $(a, b)$}. A function $f$ is called \emph{continuous on
  $[a, b]$} if
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $f$ is continuous at $x$ for all $x$ in $(a, b)$,
    \item $\lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = f(a)$ and $\lim_{x \to b^-} f(x) = f(b)$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
  If $f$ and $g$ are continuous at $a$, then
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $f + g$ is continuous at $a$,
    \item $f \cdot g$ is continuous at $a$.
  \end{enumerate}
  Moreover, if $g(a) \neq 0$, then
  \begin{enumerate}
    \setcounter{enumi}{2}
    \item $1/g$ is continuous at $a$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
  If $g$ is continuous at $a$, and $f$ is continuous at $g(a)$, then $f \circ
  g$ is continuous at $a$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Let $\epsilon > 0$. We wish to find a $\delta > 0$ such that for all $x$,
  \begin{align*}
    \text{if } |x - a| < \delta, &\text{ then } |(f \circ g)(x) -
    (f \circ g)(a)| < \epsilon, \\
    &\text{i.e., } |f(g(x)) - f(g(a))| < \epsilon.
  \end{align*}
  Since $f$ is continuous at $g(a)$, there is a $\delta' > 0$ such that for all
  $x$, \[
    \text{if } |g(x) - g(a)| < \delta', \text{ then } |f(g(x)) - f(g(a))| <
      \epsilon.
  \] We also conclude, by the continuity of $g$ at $a$, that there is a $\delta
  > 0$ such that for all $x$, \[
    \text{if } |x - a| < \delta, \text{ then } |g(x) - g(a)| < \delta'.
  \] Combining these two statements, we see that for all $x$, \[
    \text{if } |x - a| < \delta, \text{ then } |f(g(x)) - f(g(a))| < \epsilon.
  \]
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
  Suppose $f$ is continuous at $a$, and $f(a) > 0$. Then there is a number
  $\delta > 0$ such that $f(x) > 0$ for all $x$ satisfying $|x - a| < \delta$.
  Similarly, if $f(a) < 0$, then there is a number $\delta > 0$ such that $f(x)
  < 0$ for all $x$ satisfying $|x - a| < \delta$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Consider the case $f(a) > 0$. Since $f$ is continuous at $a$, if $\epsilon >
  0$ there is a $\delta > 0$ such that, for all $x$, \[
    \text{if } |x - a| < \delta, \text{ then } |f(x) - f(a)| < \epsilon.
  \] Since $f(a) > 0$ we can take $f(a)$ as the $\epsilon$. Thus there is a
  $\delta > 0$ so that for all $x$, \[
    \text{if } |x - a| < \delta, \text{ then } |f(x) - f(a)| < f(a),
  \] and this last inequality implies $f(x) > 0$. A similar proof can be given
  in the case $f(a) < 0$.
\end{proof}

\section*{Exercises}

\paragraph{Problem 12}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item Consider a function $G$ with $G(x) = g(x)$ for $x \neq a$, and $G(a) =
    l$. Such a function is guaranteed to be continuous at $a$.

    Then, from Theorem 2, it is clear that as $G$ is continuous at $a$ and $f$
    is continuous at $G(a)$, then $f \circ G$ is continuous at $a$. Thus, $f(l)
    = f(G(a)) = \lim_{x \to a} f(G(x)) = \lim_{x \to a} (f \circ G)(x)$ which
    proves the statement.
  \item Let $g = l + x - a$ and \[
    f(x) = \begin{cases}
      0, &x \neq l, \\
      1, &x = l.
    \end{cases}
  \] Then, as $\lim_{x \to a} g(x) = l$, $f(\lim_{x \to a} g(x)) = 1$. Yet,
  since $g(x) \neq l$ for $x \neq a$, $\lim_{x \to a} f(g(x)) = 0$.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Problem 16}
\begin{enumerate}[(d)]
  \item Let $g(a) = \lim_{y \to a}f(y)$. By definition, for any $\epsilon > 0$,
    there is a $\delta > 0$ such that $|f(y) - g(a)| < \epsilon$ for $|y - a| <
    \delta$. Similarly, $|g(x) - g(a)| = |\lim_{y \to x} f(y) - g(a)| <
    \epsilon$ for $|x - a| < \delta$, which shows that $g$ is continuous at
    $a$.
\end{enumerate}
